So when we're training a model for mass language modeling, we need a few tensors. We need three tensors. And this is for training Roberta, by the way, as well. Same thing with Bert as well. We have our input IDs, attention mask, and our labels. Our input IDs have roughly 15% of their values masked. So we can see that here we have these two tensors. These are the labels.

If you don't have that fine. Another option is that you have a semantic textual similarity data set or STS and what this is is you have so you have sentence A here, sentence B here and then you have a score from from 0 to 1 that tells you the similarity between those two scores and you would train this using something like cosine similarity loss. Now if that's not an option and your focus or use case is on building a sentence transformer for another language where there is no current sentence transformer you can use multilingual parallel data. So what I mean by that is so parallel data just means translation pairs so if you have for example a English sentence and then you have another language here so it can it can be anything I'm just going to put XX and that XX is your target language you can fine-tune a model using something called multilingual knowledge distillation and what that does is takes a monolingual model for example in English and using those translation pairs it distills the knowledge the semantic similarity knowledge from that monolingual English model into a multilingual model which can handle both English and your target language. So they're three options quite popular very common that you can go for and as a supervised methods the chances are that probably going to outperform anything you do with unsupervised training at least for now. So if none of those sound like something\\n\\n---\\n\\nwere actually more accurate. So we can't really do that. We can't use this what is called a mean pooling approach. Or we can't use it in its current form. Now the solution to this problem was introduced by two people in 2019 Nils Reimers and Irenia Gurevich. They introduced what is the first sentence transformer or sentence BERT. And it was found that sentence BERT or S BERT outformed all of the previous Save the Art models on pretty much all benchmarks. Not all of them but most of them. And it did it in a very quick time. So if we compare it to BERT, if we wanted to find the most similar sentence pair from 10,000 sentences in that 2019 paper they found that with BERT that took 65 hours. With S BERT embeddings they could create all the embeddings in just around five seconds. And then they could compare all those with cosine similarity in 0.01 seconds. So it's a lot faster. We go from 65 hours to just over five seconds which is I think pretty incredible. Now I think that's pretty much all the context we need behind sentence transformers. And what we do now is dive into a little bit of how they actually work. Now we said before we have the core transform models and what S BERT does is fine tunes on sentence pairs using what is called a Siamese architecture or Siamese network. What we mean by a Siamese network is that we have what we can see, what can view as two BERT models that are identical and the weights between those two models are tied. Now in reality when implementing this we just use a single BERT model. And what we do is we process one sentence, a sentence A through the model and then we process another sentence, sentence B through the model. And that's the sentence pair. So with our cross-linked we were processing the sentence pair together. We were putting them both together, processing them all at once. This time we process them separately. And during training what happens is the weights\\n\\n---\\n\\nTransformer-based Sequential Denoising Autoencoder. So what we'll do is jump straight into it and take a look at where we might want to use this training approach and and how we can actually implement it. So the first question we need to ask is do we really need to resort to unsupervised training? Now what we're going to do here is just have a look at a few of the most popular training approaches and what sort of data we need for that. So the first one we're looking at here is Natural Language Inference or NLI and NLI requires that we have pairs of sentences that are labeled as either contradictory, neutral which means they're not necessarily related or as entailing or as inferring each other. So you have pairs that entail each other so they are both very similar pairs that are neutral and also pairs that are contradictory. And this is the traditional NLI data. Now using another version of fine-tuning with NLI called a multiple negatives ranking loss you can get by with only entailment pairs so pairs that are related to each other or positive pairs and it can also use contradictory pairs to improve the performance of training as well but you don't need it. So if you have positive pairs of related sentences you can go ahead and actually try training or fine-tuning using NLI with multiple negative ranking loss. If you don't have that fine. Another option is that you have a semantic textual similarity data set or STS and what this is is you have so you have sentence A here, sentence B\\n\\nQuestion: Which training method should I use for sentence transformers when I only have pairs of related sentences?\\nAnswer:\""
